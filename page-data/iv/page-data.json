Got into a hotel where we had to fresh up. After all the morning runs, we freshened up and went to another restaurant to get breakfast before going to Malpe. The restaurant we went to was so visually appealing in the inside but felt a bit shaggy on the outside. We got our food and set out for Malpe. Digging into Malpe, it is a quite awesome place with much adventurous stuff like parasailing, speedboating and other stuff whose name I don\\u2019t remember now. The beach was bustling with people. Students who came for excursions and people who want to escape the heat and many. The best thing about Malpe is St Marys Island. As the name suggests, it\\u2019s an Island in the near 300m of the mainland beach. The only way to reach the island was through boat(Duh!!!). So we got on one went there and continued with the Journey.\\nSt Marys Island was a privatized beach/island where it would cost you a fortune if you lived there. Water costs you 30rs and that\\u2019s Rs10 more than what you get here and everything there is business. The scenic beauty of St Mary\\u2019s Island is exquisite.

Some of went to jump in the water there and had cooled down from the heat. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"After the beach we went to the same hotel we had gone in the morning for our Lunch, had a wonderful lunch and we proceeded with our trip to Coorg.

We were amazed by the depth of the film, the perspective of love, the perspective of money and life. We reached Coorg at about 9 PM and straightly went to a DJ House. In our way, to Coorg, it felt more like Kottayam with the Rubber trees and the Arecanut and Cashew Plantations. That place was made specifically for this purpose and was almost filled with students.

The university building was closed since it was Sunday and we took a group photo to compensate that journey. Then we went to the Sun temple and we were blessed enough to see Buddhist Prayers. That was very peaceful to hear to gave a positive feeling to us all. The Golden temple could be seen anywhere from Coorg and was quite big. The statues and sculptures gave a very new perspective for us towards Buddhism and were quite interesting to explore. Coorg was more of a filler episode in our journey \\uD83D\\uDE1D. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Our next place in Coorg was the Bamboo forest.

The best things in the Bamboo forest are the streams and the photography places and ofc seeing deers and stags and fawns quite close. We went upstream looking for picturesque locations and found a place without many people and took ourselves a lot of pictures. That was fun explorations. Rather than that noting worthy to telling happened in Bamboo Forests and we went back to get on the bus to get Lunch.

We had ourselves a campfire and dance and got ourselves food. By 10 pm we started our trekking journey to Ambukuthi Hill\\u2019s top. We went through Grasslands, Coffee plantations and even got up steep rocks in the middle of the night. Most of didn\\u2019t think that we could do that. At the top, it was quite chilly and in front of us, we could see the city of Sulthan Bathery. Sulthan Bathery in Night is sol cool.\\nAt the top, we had to set up tents up ourselves and that was a fun experience.

On reaching there we were told that we were at the origin of a tributary of the Chaliyar river. It went through rocks of sizes big and small and we were told that that water was safe to drink. We drank lots of water from the stream. The rocks were polished by the water for thousands of years. The guide there told us that the smallest rock had been there for a minimum of 30,000 years and the water polished and eroded it in the time when the water flows. We could walk through the rocks all the way. It almost felt like spiderman jumping and doing parkour. We treaded so much distance by jumping through the rocks.
